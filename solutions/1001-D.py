Problem id: 1001-D
Statement: You are given a qubit which is guaranteed to be either in  or in  state. 

Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 1 if it was a  state or -1 if it was  state. The state of the qubit after the operations does not matter.

You have to implement an operation which takes a qubit as an input and returns an integer. 

Your code should have the following signature:
