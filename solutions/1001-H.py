Problem id: 1001-H
Statement: Implement a quantum oracle on N qubits which implements the following function: , i.e., the value of the function is 1 if x has odd number of 1s, and 0 otherwise.

You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:

The operation doesn't have an output; the "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the qubits.

Your code should have the following signature:
