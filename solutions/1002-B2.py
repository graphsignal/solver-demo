Problem id: 1002-B2
Statement: You are given N qubits (2 ≤ N ≤ 8) which are guaranteed to be in one of the two states:

Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 0 if it was GHZ state or 1 if it was W state. The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.

You have to implement an operation which takes an array of N qubits as an input and returns an integer. 

Your code should have the following signature:
