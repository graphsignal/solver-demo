Problem id: 1002-B4
Statement: You are given 2 qubits which are guaranteed to be in one of the four orthogonal states:

Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return the index of that state (0 for , 1 for  etc.). The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.

You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 2 qubits as an input and returns an integer. 

Your code should have the following signature:
