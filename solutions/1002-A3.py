Problem id: 1002-A3
Statement: You are given N qubits (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) in zero state . You are also given two bitstrings bits0 and bits1 which describe two different basis states on N qubits  and .

Your task is to generate a state which is an equal superposition of the given basis states:

You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:

The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.

Your code should have the following signature:
